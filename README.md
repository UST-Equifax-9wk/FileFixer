# RevShop from Team A

## Written by Arvin Shertukde, Ciaran Diep, Divya Desai, and Roman Mazzoni

## Application Overview

Just create the JSON converter. Start with command line version, and layer more UI on later.
Stretch goals: Any UI at all, ability to have dynamic schema, schema defined on a per-thing
basis in config files. UI can show the object JSON, and store object in DB too.

## User Stories:

As a user I should be able to

1. Choose a file layout
2. Choose a fixed file to convert
3. View the fileâ€™s JSON representation
